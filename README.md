# Algorithm Implementations

Welcome to the Algorithm Implementations repository! This repository contains various algorithm implementations categorized into different folders for better organization and ease of access. Below is the structure and purpose of each folder.

## Folder Structure

### 1. Sorting Algorithms
This folder contains implementations of various sorting algorithms(ascending n descending).
**Algorithms included:**
- Bubble Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Heap Sort

### 2. Searching Algorithms
This folder includes implementations of different searching algorithms. 
**Algorithms included:**
- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)


### 3. Algorithm Collections
This folder contains my implementations of various algorithms that I have learned about. These algorithms cover a range of topics and problem-solving techniques.

**Algorithms included:**
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Knapsack Problem
- Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
- Prim's and Kruskal's Algorithms
  ...

## How to Use

Each folder contains subfolders or files for individual algorithms. Each algorithm includes:
- The source code implementation (in Python, C, JavaScript and Java)
- A brief explanation or comments within the code
- Example usage or test cases
