<ol> Anagram Check</ol>
<p>description: Given two strings, check to see if they are anagrams. An anagram is when two strings can be written using the exact same letters(can be rearranged to get a different phrase or word) e.g.
``` "public relations" is an anagram of "crap built on lies."
"clint eastwood" is an anagram of "old west action"
```
